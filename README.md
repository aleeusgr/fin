### models:

lucas - asset is a claim to a stream of endowment

### tests: 
util/visual: generate timeseries
    /metrics: 
#IDEAS:
# 4. stock price: core and sentiment; see shefrin.

test fails, need to update api keys, dependencies.
P*ln(claim) - need to maximize

claim_vector*state_price_vector = W  - constraint

questions:
 which P? 

two unknowns, but the function is supposed to have MAX value.
